# Feature Specification: Bidirectional Synchronization Between etcd and PostgreSQL

**Feature Branch**: `001-describe-building-a`  
**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Describe building a bidirectional synchronization system between etcd and PostgreSQL to maintain consistent key-value data with revision control. The system ensures real-time mirroring of etcd data in PostgreSQL and propagates changes from PostgreSQL back to etcd with conflict resolution, retry, and compaction handling. The goal is reliable, efficient synchronization for applications needing consistent distributed configuration or state storage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A system administrator or application operator needs to ensure that key-value data stored in etcd and PostgreSQL remains consistent at all times, with changes in either system reliably reflected in the other. The system must handle conflicts, retries, and data compaction transparently, supporting applications that depend on up-to-date distributed configuration or state storage.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** etcd contains new or updated key-value pairs, **When** the synchronization system is running, **Then** those changes are reflected in PostgreSQL in near real-time, preserving revision history.
2. **Given** PostgreSQL contains new or updated key-value pairs, **When** the synchronization system is running, **Then** those changes are propagated to etcd, with conflict resolution applied if necessary.
3. **Given** a network partition or temporary failure, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** the system retries synchronization and resolves any conflicts according to defined rules.
4. **Given** etcd compaction occurs, **When** the system attempts to synchronize, **Then** it handles compaction gracefully without data loss or inconsistency.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when both etcd and PostgreSQL are updated for the same key at nearly the same time? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the conflict resolution policy—last write wins, manual intervention, or other?]
- How does the system handle schema changes or incompatible data types between etcd and PostgreSQL? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there constraints on key/value formats?]
- What is the expected latency for "real-time" synchronization? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a maximum acceptable delay?]
- How are deletions handled—should deletes in one system be mirrored in the other? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is soft or hard delete required?]
- What are the retry policies and backoff strategies for transient errors? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there limits or escalation procedures?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST synchronize key-value data from etcd to PostgreSQL in near real-time, including revision information.
- **FR-002**: System MUST propagate changes from PostgreSQL back to etcd, ensuring bidirectional consistency.
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and resolve conflicts when the same key is modified in both systems. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specify conflict resolution policy]
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle etcd compaction events without data loss or inconsistency.
- **FR-005**: System MUST retry synchronization after transient failures, with configurable retry and backoff policies. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define retry/backoff parameters]
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all synchronization events, errors, and conflict resolutions for auditability.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support configuration of which key-value namespaces or tables are synchronized. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is partial sync required?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure data integrity and consistency across both systems at all times.
- **FR-009**: System MUST support secure communication between etcd, PostgreSQL, and the synchronization service. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Security/compliance requirements?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide monitoring and alerting for synchronization failures or inconsistencies. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the monitoring/alerting requirements?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Key-Value Record**: Represents a single key-value pair, including metadata such as revision, timestamp, and source system.
- **Revision History**: Tracks changes to key-value records over time, supporting conflict resolution and auditability.
- **Synchronization Event**: Represents an action taken to mirror or propagate a change between systems, including status and error details.
